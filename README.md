# Sidecar Tests
Some python scripts to test the sidecar implementation for Moonbeam/Moonriver/Moonbase Alpha.  
All of the bash scripts are currently set to use Moonbase Alpha.  

`requirements.txt` has all of the required python packages, which can be installed via pip.  

`sidecar.sh` is a bash script that can set up a Moonbase Alpha instance of sidecar.  

`monitor.sh` is a bash script that runs the python tests. Use after running `sidecar.sh`.
